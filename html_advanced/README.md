Atlas School Project on HTML and CSS. By James Hamby (james.hamby@atlasschool.com)

## What are HTML and CSS?

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is used to give content structure and meaning by defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, or images. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a presentation language that styles the appearance of content using fonts, colors, and more.

### Understanding Common HTML Terms

When starting with HTML, you will encounter new terms. Three common terms are elements, tags, and attributes.

#### Elements

Elements define the structure and content of objects within a page. Common elements include headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), and others like `<a>`, `<div>`, `<span>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>`.

#### Tags

Tags are created using angle brackets and define elements. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. For example, `<div>` is an opening tag, and `</div>` is a closing tag. The content between these tags is the element's content.

#### Attributes

Attributes provide additional information about an element. Common attributes include `id`, `class`, `src`, and `href`. Attributes are defined within the opening tag and usually consist of a name and a value, such as `id="header"`.

### Why HTML and CSS?

HTML and CSS exist to make web content accessible and visually appealing. HTML structures the content, while CSS styles it. They are independent languages and should remain separate.

### Who are HTML and CSS for?

HTML and CSS are for anyone who uses the web. They enable the creation of websites that provide information and services to users.
