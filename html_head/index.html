    <section class="why-atlas">
        <h2>Why I chose Atlas</h2>
        <p>
            I chose Atlas because I wanted to be in a class with people who are as driven as I am.
            I also wanted to be in a class that was more focused on the work and less on the drama.
            I have also tried to teach myself coding many times on my own and just couldn't get myself to do it. Having people around me helps!

            I aspire to own a hosting company for websites, games, and more, and eventually own a datacenter.
